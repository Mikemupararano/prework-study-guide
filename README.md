# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

Research shows that many new developers find learning coding challenging. The reason is that there is a lack of succinct literature on what to focus on when one embarks on the coding learning journey. This Pre-work study guide application explains HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git in the form of brief notes. If a new learner can focus on the first few key ideas, then they can be expected to make great progress.

In working on this project, I took the initial steps to learn about using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git. Previously, I had not taken serious attention on Git for example, and through this project, I was able to master git more.

Readers are encouraged to read the notes on HTML and the various elements that make HTML, such as head, body, h1, h2, and html. HTML provides structure and is like the frame that holds a building together. 

It is crucial to read the notes on CSS, and JavaScript and then practice basic coding on Freecodecamp. The secret of success in coding is to write code. 

To understand the code that was used to write this application, press CTRL + Shift and then I, on Windows. Click on the web developer tools tabs and see the CSS style that the author used, for example.
